# Day 2: Navigation, Architecture Basics and UI Introduction

### Aligning the Stand
Ensure that everyone has completed the tile parser from Day 1.

### Introduction to Navigation Graphs
Navigation graphs in KMP help manage the flow between screens. Learn how to define routes, navigate between destinations, and pass data using NavHost and composables.

### Introduction to Manual Dependency Injection
Learn how to inject dependencies manually (e.g., via AppContainer) to achieve loose coupling. This includes creating Repositories and ViewModels for clean architecture.

### Introduction to Jetpack Compose
Jetpack Compose is the modern UI framework for Android and KMP. Learn composables, Modifier for styling, and basic layouts like Column and Row.

### Introduction to State Management with StateFlows
Learn how to manage UI state reactively using StateFlows in ViewModels. StateFlows emit state changes, triggering UI updates automatically.
