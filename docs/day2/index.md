# Day 2: Frontend Introduction, Navigation and UI Polish

## Overview
Today you dive the frontend with Jetpack Compose and Material Design 3, learning how composables, themes, and previews fit together. You'll build a reactive player selection screen, then connect screens with a clean navigation graph and back navigation. To wrap up the day, you'll extract reusable UI elements and polish the layout using app bars.

## Before You Start
Make sure you have completed all Day 1 tasks and that your project matches the expected baseline.

!!! warning "Important"
    Whenever you need to import objects from external libraries and have more than one option to choose from, prioritize `androidx.compose` and `material3` imports.
