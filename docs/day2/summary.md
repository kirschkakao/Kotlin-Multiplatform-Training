# Day 2: Summary

## What You've Accomplished Today

You started with Jetpack Compose fundamentals and Material Design 3, learning how composables, theming, and previews work together to build modern UI. Then you implemented a reactive player selection screen, wiring up state so the UI responds to user input.

Next, you designed and implemented a clear navigation graph, registered destinations, and added forward and back navigation with `NavHostController`. Finally, you polished the UI by extracting reusable components, introducing a shared top app bar, and refining layout and spacing for a consistent look across screens.
