# Day 2: Summary

## What You've Accomplished Today

You started with Jetpack Compose fundamentals and Material Design 3, learning how composables, theming, and previews work together to build modern UI. Then you implemented a reactive player selection screen, wiring up state so the UI responds to user input.

Next, you designed and implemented a clear navigation graph, registered destinations, and added forward and back navigation with `NavHostController`.

Finally, you polished the UI by extracting reusable components, introducing a shared top app bar, and refining layout and spacing for a consistent look across screens.

## What's Coming Tomorrow

Tomorrow you'll move beyond the frontend and connect your UI to business logic and persistent data. You'll implement ViewModels and manual dependency injection to manage state properly, then create repositories and data access objects to persist your game state across screens. By the end of the day, you'll have built a complete three-layer architecture connecting your UI all the way down to your database.
