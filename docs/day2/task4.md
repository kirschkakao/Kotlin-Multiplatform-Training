# Task 4: Beautify the Screens

In this task we will make the screen design consistent and more appealing. We will also streamline the code structure and create reusable frontend elements that can be used across different screens. This makes it easier to maintain an consitent look and while also reducing the amount of code we need to write for each screen.

## The Welcome Screen

In the beginning of the course, the Welcoem Screen was a simple appetizer with some flashy animations to get you excited about the course. Now it's time to make it a real welcome screen that gives you a clear entry point into the game.
