# Day 1: Setup, Kotlin Basics and Tile Parser

## Overview
Today you'll start your journey into Kotlin and Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) development. We'll set up the necessary tools and dive into the fundamentals.

### Tools We Use
For this training, we use two IDEs:

- **Android Studio**: For the main Carcassonne training project (KMP desktop app)
- **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**: For learning Kotlin basics and running small Kotlin tests independently

Both IDEs share Kotlin's powerful development experience, so you'll become familiar with the Kotlin ecosystem.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. [Kotlin Introduction](kotlin_introduction/index.md)
Learn Kotlin fundamentals in **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**. This module covers everything you need to know about Kotlin before jumping into the main project. Since our training project is built with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), a solid understanding of Kotlin is essential.

### 2. [Tool Installation and Setup](task1.md)
Install **Android Studio** and configure your environment. Set up the Carcassonne training project and prepare your development workspace.

### 3. [Understand the Project Structure](task2.md)
Explore the codebase of the Carcassonne KMP project. Learn how the project is organized and understand the architecture.

### 4. [Implement the Tile Parser](task3.md)
Program a tile parser to load game assets from JSON. This task reinforces Kotlin concepts like data classes and immutability while building a core component of the game.
