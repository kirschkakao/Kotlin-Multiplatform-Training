# Day 1: Basics and Tile Parser

### Introduction to Kotlin
Kotlin is a modern programming language that is interoperable with Java and optimized for multiplatform development. You will learn the basics: variables, functions, classes, data classes, and null safety.

### Tool Installation
Install IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio, the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin, and the required SDKs for desktop (Windows).

### Checking Out the Starting Point
Check out the start repository: An empty KMP app for Windows that displays the Carcassonne logo and already contains assets (tile graphics).

### Task: Program the Tile Parser
Program a parser in Kotlin that reads the tiles into an internal immutable data structure. Link them with metadata: what is visible on the tile, connection points, etc. Use the Carcassonne manual as a reference.

!!! tip
    Check in your solution to the repository so that the trainer can review it.
