# Task 1: Learn Kotlin Basics

### About This Task
In this task, you'll learn **Kotlin fundamentals** using **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**. Since our training project is built with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), a solid understanding of Kotlin is essential.

We've prepared a comprehensive Kotlin introduction module that covers all the basics you need to know before diving into the main project.

### Setup: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
To complete this task, you need to install **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** with a proper Kotlin SDK:

1. **Download IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**: Get it from [JetBrains' download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
2. **Install a Kotlin SDK**: During setup, make sure you have a compatible Java SDK installed (version 11 or higher recommended). IntelliJ will automatically configure Kotlin support.

The version doesn't matter too much – just ensure you have a recent version and a proper SDK configured.


### Next Steps
- Proceed to the [Kotlin Introduction module](kotlin_introduction/index.md) to start learning.
- Work through each chapter at your own pace.
- Practice code examples in IntelliJ to reinforce your understanding.
