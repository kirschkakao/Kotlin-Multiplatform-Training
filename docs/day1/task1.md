# Task 1: Learn Kotlin Basics

### About This Task
In this task, you'll learn **Kotlin fundamentals** using **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**. Since our training project is built with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), a solid understanding of Kotlin is essential.

We've prepared a [Kotlin Introduction](https://kirschkakao.github.io/KotlinIntroduction/) site that covers all the basics you need to know before diving into the main project.

### Setup: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
To complete this task, you might want to install **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** (get it from [JetBrains' download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/))

The version doesn't matter too much – just ensure you have a recent version and a proper Kotlin SDK configured. A short guide on how to set up your project is provided in the [Kotlin Introduction](https://kirschkakao.github.io/KotlinIntroduction/)

If you do not want to install IntelliJ, you can as well use the official [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/) that provides an online IDE.


### Next Steps
- Proceed to the [Kotlin Introduction](https://kirschkakao.github.io/KotlinIntroduction/) to start learning.
- Work through each chapter at your own pace.
