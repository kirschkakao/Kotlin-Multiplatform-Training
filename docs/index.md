# Welcome to the Kotlin Multiplatform Training

This training introduces you to the development of Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) applications, with a practical focus on building a Carcassonne game.

Over 5 days, you will learn fundamental concepts of Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material Design 3, navigation graphs, state management with StateFlows, and manual dependency injection while gradually developing a complete game.

Since this course is a bit more advanced than the introductory courses, participants are expected to have successfully completed the basic IT training and have a fundamental understanding of modern programming techniques and tools such as:

- version control with Git
- programming and testing in general
- classes, interfaces, inheritance
- dependency injection

However, unlike the basic IT training, which is completely self-paced based on the training materials and allows everyone to progress at their own speed over the 4 days, this course ensures that everyone is roughly at the same level by the end. Every morning (from Day 2 to 5), checkpoints are released that you can obtain if needed, depending on whether you require them to successfully continue with the new tasks the next day. The tasks are much more challenging, so no one should finish significantly before the end of the day. The trainers will be present to support you in case you have further questions or get stuck.

In general, you can use all helping tools you like (Google, AI, etc.), but keep in mind that the goal of this course is not to have a perfect solution (nothing will be graded), but rather that you develop a good understanding of the training contents. So we kindly ask you not to just copy solutions, for your own good. As with any other training, this is meant to improve your skillset.

!!! note
    Make sure you have installed the required tools (see Day 1). The code will be provided in a separate repository, and you will check in your progress there.
