# Task 1: Reusable Grid Class

### Why a Reusable Grid?
Grids are essential for game UIs. This task teaches abstraction and reusability in Compose, creating a base class for different grid types.

### Task: Implement the Grid Class
1. **Create Base Grid**: Define a generic Grid composable that handles rows/columns and item placement.
2. **Derive Specific Grids**: Extend for TileGrid (for tiles) and FollowerGrid (for followers).
3. **Add Interactivity**: Allow clicking cells to trigger actions.

### What It Should Look Like Now
- Grid renders correctly with placeholders.
- Derived grids work for tiles/followers.
- Code is reusable across components.

!!! tip
    Use LazyVerticalGrid or custom layouts for efficiency.
