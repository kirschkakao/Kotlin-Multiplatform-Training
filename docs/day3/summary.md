# Day 3: Summary

## What You've Accomplished Today

Today you connected the frontend to the backend and started building the tile card component. You implemented ViewModels and set up manual dependency injection to manage your application's state and dependencies properly. You then persisted and managed game state using StateFlows, ensuring your UI reacts correctly to state changes.

## What's Coming Tomorrow

Tomorrow you'll focus on the game screen and reusable grid components. You'll implement a reusable grid for displaying and managing game tiles, continuing to build out the core game interface.
