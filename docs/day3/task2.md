# Task 2: Program the Game Board

### Why a Game Board?
The board ties everything together: tiles, state, and rules. This task focuses on integrating grids with game logic and reactive UI.

### Task: Build the Game Board
1. **Integrate Grid**: Use the TileGrid to display placed tiles.
2. **Add Placement Logic**: Allow dragging/clicking to place/rotate tiles per rules.
3. **Manage State**: Use ViewModels and StateFlows for board state (positions, rotations).

### What It Should Look Like Now
- Board shows tiles in a grid.
- Placement works with validation.
- UI updates reactively on changes.

!!! note
    Complex; pair program if needed.
