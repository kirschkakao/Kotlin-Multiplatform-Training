# Day 4: Summary

## What You've Accomplished Today

Today you built a reusable grid component for your game screen. This grid component provides the foundation for displaying game tiles in an organized, interactive way, and will serve as a key building block for your game interface throughout the rest of the implementation.

## What's Coming Tomorrow

Tomorrow you'll move into implementing the scoring system. You'll design and implement scoring areas and complete all the associated game logic needed to track points and manage game progression.
