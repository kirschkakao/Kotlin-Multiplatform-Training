### Task: Implement Followers and Scoring
1. **Follower Placement**: Add logic to place followers on tiles per rules, using grids and state.
2. **Scoring Calculation**: Implement scoring for Cities, Roads, Farms. Update scores reactively.
3. **Integrate DI**: Ensure ViewModels inject scoring services.

### What It Should Look Like Now
- Followers place correctly on tiles.
- Scores calculate and display accurately.
- Game ends with final scores.
